             <div class="blog-entry">The game I have been working on has me stumped right now. I've got a lot of the game itself done but 
                its the logic part I am stuck on. I am starting to get frusterated so I may take a break from the game for now, or only work on the CSS 
                part of it. I am thinking I'll start back up with the freecodecamp project tutorials and see if I understand things better.
                I feel like I have a better understanding of javascript but i still have a ways to go.
                <br> <br>
                My dad bought my christmas presents early! I asked for a desk and a 1tb m.2 drive. I am going to use the drive to dual boot Linux. 
                I am not super versed on it. I've used Ubuntu before and I have a Raspberry Pi, but i need to use it more. I got the distro Elementary, it 
                looks a lot like Mac OS. I am excited to use it and learn more about Linux.

             <div class="blog-entry">I've been making a lot of progress on the game I am building. I've edited the CSS to make it 
                look better too and added a font: 
                <img src="/blog-main/portfolio/imgs/gameprog2.JPG" class="blog-img">
                I was having a lot of trouble trying to randomize the array I have everyones names in but i figured it out. the plan now 
                is to randomize the birthday month, possibly the day, and year and display them on the card. I also need to figure out the math 
                part of this. I want the score number for losses and wins color to change if the number is bigger than zero too.
                I also want to give the ID a little more character, I might go in to an art app and make a bunch of different 'conditions' of the ID,
                like more intact/battered and used. I think I will be able to get the logic down for this project, I was really having a hard time 
                the other day trying to figure it out and i was stumped for hours. But I am on my way now to making this game.

            <span class="blog-title">JS Game<span class="date">12/12/23</span></span>
             <div class="blog-entry">Today I have been working on my JS game i was talking about yesterday! I have decided to call it 
                Accepted and Denied. I have made the start of the game screen, here is a picture of the progress:
                <img src="/blog-main/portfolio/imgs/gameprog.JPG" class="blog-img">
                I'm a little scared to start the javascript part, but I think I will learn a lot doing this and I think it will 
                also look good on my portfolio lol.
                <br> <br>
                So for the functionality, I plan for the accept button to check if the expiration date is equal or less than the current date. If it is then 
                the next check is if the birthday is equal to or more than the date that makes you 21 (i think). If those all pass than you get a point,
                if its not right, I'll have another counter that logs how many you've missed, you can only miss five before the game ends. I might also 
                want to add a timer so if time runs out and you haven't decided, its a loss, but i dont know about that. I'll have to add some more stuff to that 
                like a counter display for wins and losses.

            <span class="blog-title">Feeling more accomplished<span class="date">12/11/23</span></span>
             <div class="blog-entry">So yesterday I started watching a 8 hour long youtube video from freecodecamp.
                In the video they are building 15 different javascript projects that are really simple. I've completed two of them 
                and they were a button that would change the background color of the page while also displaying what color the background was, 
                and the second one was a counter with three buttons, one would increase the count by 1, one would decrease the count by 1 
                and one would reset the count back to zero. I went back over the color changing one today and took some notes without coding, and then
                created it again using only my notes. I was able to after some time. I feel like i've actually learned something 
                and retained it. I also learned the the DOM in javascript is not what everyone uses, thats where React comes in. 
                I did't know that and im glad i learned that because working with the DOM is kinda tiring. On another note, I have sent a message 
                to Two Barrels asking if their junior positions are eligible for a hybrid work setup. I hope its hybrid 
                so they can fly me out to the office every month (maybe). I think that would be really fun and good for me.
                <br> <br>
                I've been going back to their website constantly. I keep looking at their 'how to get the job' page and re-reading it. I also saw on their 
                benefits page that they offer a work from home fund/stipend. They say you can use it for whatever and even some people get a monthly stipend.
                Thats really really cool. I would use it to get a new desk and chair for sure.
                <br> <br>
                Update on the blog, I've changed the background color to grey instead of purple and I think I'll be changing the border of the 
                blog post. Right now its a gradient of red to blue. It looks cool but I'm looking for a more sleek look.
                I made the header look a lot better, darker grey background with no border, at the top of the page.
                <br> <br>
                I have an idea for a project, I want to make a simple game. No graphics or anything, just a vanilla javascript game. I want to create a bunch of ID's 
                and make it a ID checking game. like you're a bouncer for a bar checking ID's and you need to let the people age 21+ in only. 
                I have a game like this on my switch and it was really cool. I'll start working on that now.

            <span class="blog-title">Having some trouble<span class="date">12/9/23</span></span>
             <div class="blog-entry">I'm feeling a little lost and overwhelmed with javascript. I feel like i need some sort of structure 
                and I'm not really getting that with youtube videos and whatnot. I've tried to go through a tutorial and 
                code along with a spending tracker app but the person on the video always types so fast and doesn't explain what they're typing 
                a lot of the time. I was also thinking that i should learn some Backbone.js because thats what they use at Two Barrels but then i got stuck because 
                I couldn't figure out the difference between libraries and frameworks. I am feeling really frazzled and I don't know where to 
                start ? I've got the javascript basics down (i think) but the more advanced stuff is scary. I don't really know what to build or 
                how to apply any of what i've learned. I'm feeling a little discouraged honestly. I downloaded a book on javascript that also 
                has jquery, maybe that'll be enough structure for me to follow. I'm kind of bouncing all over the place and its really 
                confusing! 
                <br> <br>
                I am also thinking of changing up how this blog looks. Its kinda blocky and ugly to me now and I think that I could do better.

             <div class="blog-entry">I am back from Chicago! It was a fun trip and Pierce the Veil was really good. I really like chicago a lot 
                and I cant wait to go back. I'm feeling a lot better about coding and stuff, I think i really needed that break for my brain. I am also 
                done with school until febuary. I plan to use this time to get better with javascript. I'm gonna do some projects, maybe even 
                try and do then without a tutorial or i'll watch the tutorial and take notes, then try and do it myself. I am not sure how much javscript 
                I need to know to be able to say 'I know javascript'. I've been trying to look up 'most important topics in js' and maybe i should keep 
                doing that.

             <div class="blog-entry">I've been feeling a little burnt out the past couple days, I think I may take a little break from web developer stuff.
                I've been doing a lot of learning with javascript and I kinda at the point where I don't really know what to do with what i've learned. 
                I now I can do the typical projects like to-do list and weather app but I think I am just gonna take a break and come back to that later. I still really 
                wanna be a web developer/software engineer but its the only thing i've been thinking about for weeks and I probably need some time to do other things. 
                <br> <br>
                those things include doing some travel and playing some video games. I am going to chicago on December 1st with some friends to see a concert. We are also 
                spending the weekend there so I think that will be a lot of fun. I am also going to New York City with my partner early January and I am also really excited for that.
                I've also just acquired the game Fallout 76. The Steam Fall sale is going on right now and my friend bought it for me, so I will be playing that today.
                <br> <br>
                When I return from my little break from developing, I do want to attempt those weather app and to-do list projects. I've already kind of tried to do them but 
                for whatever reason I did not finish them. I'm gonna try and keep up with my javascript knowledge with some exercises I find online, I don't wanna come back in 
                not knowing how to do anything.

            <span class="blog-title">Javascript<span class="date">11/24/23</span></span>
             <div class="blog-entry">So for the past two days i've been on w3schools reading up on the 
                javascript syntax and everything else. It seems similar to python but no entirely the same. 
                I've learned a lot of stuff and written it down in my notebook. I really want to try and make something with 
                what I learned now but maybe i should learn more about the DOM first. I also getting really antsy and 
                i want to apply for that job at Two Barrels but i really think I should wait. I'm so hype about it that if i got 
                rejected it would probably do a huge blow to my me in general, so i will wait and learn more javascript.
                <br> <br>
                I also really need to learn more about html forms and how to make a responsive site or a 'mobile first' site. 
                I've tried to make a responsive website before but the media query thing is kinda confusing. I am not really sure 
                what to put in it and what not. But i will figure that out.

            <span class="blog-title">Progress on game frames<span class="date">11/21/23</span></span>
            <div class="blog-entry">I'v made a lot of progress on the game frames i wanted to make. I uploaded them to github 
                so i can work on them from my laptop and computer. They look really good! I think i can add more to them though to really make 
                them pop. I'm not sure what though. I know i need to change the font on the summary text for the frames. Heres a picture 
                of the Katamari one I made:
                <img src="/blog-main/portfolio/imgs/katamari.JPG" class="blog-img" alt="katamari">
                <br>
                I really like the way this one turned out. I added an ID to all the frames so i could customize the background 
                color of the frames. Here is the github pages link to see the whole thing: <a href="https://fiddlefig.github.io/game-frames/">Game Frames</a>.
                <br> <br> 
                This is future me from 12/11/23, I have edited the button I originally had, they were very simple and just changed 
                the color of the button. Now these buttons change the color of the border and I'm not sure what i should make the 
                other one do.
                <br> 
                it was pretty fun to figure out. I'll probably put in a button on this blog post that will change something in the post. <br>
                <button id="btn">Change border color</button>
                <button>Change font</button>
                <br>
                So far all i can figure out is how to change then styling of things, I will figure out more here soon.

            <div class="blog-entry">Today I was listening to some podcast at work, I listen to a bunch on coding and becoming a software 
                developer and its just making me more excited to become one! I can't wait to start learning javascript, I haven't started because 
                i am currently in a python class and I can't learn two languages at once. I think i will get a good 
                grasp on it once i start, i took a class on it in college in 2019 and i really liked it. <br> <br> 
                I've also started doing more research on the company I want to work at, Two Barrels. I read through all the pages 
                they have on their site, they said they are always hiring so thats a plus. They also want a cover letter to come with your application. 
                Your app won't get viewed if you don't submit one, but they also want the cover letter to be relaxed and not super robotic 
                and corporate coded, which is great because i do not do great in those kind of areas. I really think i have a shot at this 
                company, I need to keep working on my projects and javascript for sure. I also want to look into the technologies they are using, ive already looked 
                into a couple, some are Django and Backbone.js. I don't really understand what they are so im going to have to 
                sit down at some point and watch a youtube video on them or something. I know this might be too early to do this but i want to 
                start drafting my cover letter too. And also unrelated but I also should really practice my typing skills, I can do 60 wpm but 
                I make some mistakes along the way, I want to be really good at typing.

                webpage. I think that would be a unique thing to do. It doesn't look crazy or anyting, just straight to the point.
                <img src="/blog-main/portfolio/imgs/resume.JPG" class="blog-img"> <br>
                So this is it so far. I don't think I'm anywhere close to being able to use this to apply for an actual 
                job. I think i need some more experience with JS and Python to confidently put those on there.
                I also need some more personal projects and maybe some open source contributions

                I think if i keep tweaking it, it'll look really cool. it looks pretty flat and and bland right now.
                I also fixed some other things, like Instead of having links to my socials that say "twitter" "linkedin"
                etc, I got the icons and made them links instead and i put them in the header instead of where the other blog 
                links are. I'm not sure what else I want to do to make this look nicer. Once i learn some more Javascript I can
                probably figure out what more to put on here.
                <br><br>
                I am also almost done with my classes for this term. I have 1-2 more seminars left and this unit and next unit, so 
                about two more weeks of this and then I get my break. I'm kinda sad I am switching over to javascript and leaving python.
                I really like python but I think its easier if I just use javascript for web development.

            <div class="blog-entry">So I was listening to a web developer podcast today and i came up with some 
                more ideas for my blog. So the first thing i want to do is choose something new to learn every day or 
                every week and post about it here in my blog. Maybe in a separate area but i think that would be a good thing to do 
                since there are still somethings i don't know how to do in HTML and CSS. The next idea was to create another page 
                where i would create custom "cards" for video games and other media i like. I think that would be a really fun thing to do 
                and it would increase my understanding of somethings in HTML and CSS. 
                <br> <br>
                There's also a project I've been thinking about and want to actually do, but it would take a lot of effort and time to do,
                i want to create a PC part tracker. I think i've said this before in a previous post, but i think it would be a really cool 
                project. I'd have to learn a lot though and i'd have to start when i'm done with this current term in school. Luckily
                I will have a nice break between end of this month to until febuary. Maybe i can try and learn some more during that time.

                planets to get trash at work sites. You then sell the trash to the company for money. There are monsters on the 
                planets that you need to avoid. Its kind of a hard game honestly and its impossible to play by yourself.
                I've enjoyed it a lot so far and I think the developers will do a good job of updating the game and keeping it 
                fun.
                <br> <br>
                Switching over to the web dev of things, I've been feeling maybe a little burnt out with it? I'm not tired of it 
                but I've been doing so much learning and i have so much more to do, It's kinda hard sometimes. But I 
                really want this for myself. I love creating things and I love the coding side of developing, this is something 
                I really wanna do and I am going to do. I know I don't have enough skills to get a job right now, but I can't wait 
                for the day I can start applying. I think I've said in the past, I really want to work at this place called Two 
                Barrels. I connected and messaged a guy on LinkedIn that works there and he didn't respond, but he read it. 
                Kinda disheartening but thats ok, I'm sure he thought i was looking to get a reference from him but that wasn't the case,
                i just wanted to know more about the company. I think when I'm ready to start apply for jobs, I'll 
                apply to other places first so i get the interview experience.
                <br> <br> 
                Some other places I want to work at are SteelSeries, Valve, Discord, Mozilla, or Logitech. 
                I wouldn't mind working at a gaming company doing web developer work. I love video games and 
                i wanna be around the industry without being in it. I'm going to keep going and doing more projects 
                so that i can be a full fledged developer. I am also wondering if I should put this on my LinkedIn, 
                I think employers would like what I'm doing, so I am going to keep this up and hopefully they find this 
                appealing in the future.

            <span class="blog-title">New monitor and remaking the calculator<span class="date">11/9/23</span></span>
            <div class="blog-entry">Yesterday walmart started their black friday deals, I saw that there was a 27 inch
                monitor on sale for $145 from $260, so i debated with myself and decided to buy it. It should be here soon.
                I had early access to the black friday deals by 3 hours because i have a walmart+ membership, i really excited!
                <br> <br>
                I also think i should try and remake the calculator i made yesterday without any youtube video, I may look at my old
                code for reference by I think this will be good for me since i kinda just copied what was on the screen.
            </div>

        <div class="blog-box">
            <span class="blog-title">Calculator w/ js <span class="date">11/8/23</span></span>
            <div class="blog-entry">So the weather app thing is taking to long to do, I really didn't
                think this would take so long. So i decided to do another project instead, an online
                calculator. I have to make sure i'm actually learning something from these videos though 
                so im going to document what i did and what each step means. <br>
                <img src="/blog-main/portfolio/imgs/calc.PNG" class="blog-img"> <br>
                so here is the calculator, you can click all the buttons and it brings up the numbers and 
                the operators. You can do everything like adding and subtracting and the = button works too. there 
                was box shadowing used in this and i still don't really understand that at all, but I'll figure it out.
                <br> <br> I first started off making a bunch on divs, one for the whole calculator which was named 'container',
                and then another div inside called 'calc' and then inside that, a form tag. inside the form tag is 
                divs for all the buttons on the calculator. the first div is for the display that shows the numbers 
                you click and the rest are the numbers and operators. <br> so the display div has another tag inside 
                called <code>'input'</code> and it has some attributes inside called <code>type=text and name='display'</code> I think the 
                'type' has certain words you're allowed to use for it. the 'name' is for whatever you want.
                <br> <br> I won't explain everything i guess because that would be a lot to write out, but maybe
                ill try and explain the JS part of it. So for the buttons, Ill explain the AC button, 
                it has <code><span class="code-text">input class = 'operator' type = 'button' value = 'AC' onClick = 'display.value = '' '.</span></code> So what 
                i think is going on here is that it is an input type, so characters go into it. Then the class is obvious, 
                I made a class to change the color of the buttons with the operator class. the value is probably 
                what goes into the display which in this case is nothing.  And the onClick probably listens for a mouse
                click by the user and executes something when that happens. when onClick is activated here, display.value 
                will equal '' or AKA a blank space.

            <span class="blog-title">Doing weather API
                thing with JS<span class="date">11/7/23</span></span>
            <div class="blog-entry">Today I decided i was going to follow a youtube tutorial on how to
                make a weather app with an API. I am afraid that I am just copying what the guy is doing 
                and not learning anything, but i also think i am learning something. <br> <br> I feel like to should 
                just do the projects that everyone does and put them on my GitHub BUT, I wont have those as the 
                main pieces i want employers to look at, everyone has those projects. I have to think about what
                i want to make. I had the idea of making a PC part price tracker website. You can go on there 
                and keep track of the price of a part you look up. I know this would be difficult but i think i 
                could do it. I also changed the border of these blog entry post to a border-image with a linear gradient,
                i wish i could give it a border radius to make it round, but i think this looks good for now. I want to 
                continue to make this blog look nice so It can be a good piece to put on my GitHub. <br><br> UPDATE, ive 
                been waiting for hours for this API key to be activated, I didn't realized free keys take forever
                to activate, so I haven't been able to continue my project, might try something that doesnt
                require an API

            <div class="blog-entry">Today I contacted Guild about switching my program at purdue global to
                a AAS in information technology with a concentration in programming and software development. They
                said that walmart has paused enrollment for the year so that 'employees can focus on the busy holiday season'. 
                I think this is stupid. Now i have to wait until febuary next year to switch. The good news is that 
                ill be able to take a break without any issue. So i'm going to use that time to make projects and learn 
                more about Javascript, React. <br> There is also a company I have been looking at for a while, they're called
                Two Barrel, I think that looks like a great place to work. They seem really relaxed and its a remote/hybrid position
                from Spokane WA. That would be so cool to get to fly out there for work. I'm gonna try really hard to get my skills 
                in order so that I can apply there. I messaged and connected with a guy that works there, he did not respond.
                Made me a little sad to be honest, but thats ok. I think what i need to do is keep working on my HTML and CSS 
                and then after i get done with my python class, I need to start learning more Javascript.

            <div class="blog-entry">So my python assignment this week was a little hard. We had to create two
                functions, one that would take a list of temperature in C and translate them to F, then display
                them side by side like <br>'the temperature is #C or #F'. Then the second function needed to put a 
                weather statement next to each temperature reading depending on the temp. I first was having issues
                trying to get the list to iterate through the math that would translate the temperature, but i eventually
                got it. I had to do <span class="code-text">'for n in temps()'</span>  and then add a variable that would store the new temps: <br>
                <span class="code-text"> 'tempF = n * 1.8 + 32'</span> then print it 'print(tempF)' and that would give me the temperature in F.

                my thought on everything i'm doing. I am currently in school to get my associates in cyber security
                but i've realized thats not what i want to do. I've seen what goes into those jobs and it looks boring.
                web development seems a lot more entertaining to me and a lot more interesting. So i will be switching my 
                associates to Information technology with a concentration in programming and software development.
