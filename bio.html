        <div class="blog-entry">My name is Sadaja Riddick-Johnson, I am 22 years old and I want to be a web developer!
            I am currently in school to get my AAS (associates) in cyber security but I have changed my mind and 
            I am going to switch it to get my associates in information technology with a concentration in programming 
            and software development. I live and am from Indiana, its pretty boring here but i live in a college town and that makes 
            things a little more fun. <br> <br> For my hobbies and things, I am really into Gundam and building gunpla, 
            if you dont know what that is, Gundam is a very huge anime series/universe. Its kinda old but they 
            have made plenty of shoes and movies to keep up with the times. But my favorite is the gunpla, they 
            are plastic model kits you can build of the gundams. Its like super advanced legos and I enjoy it a lot!
            I am also into the Nintendo series Splatoon, I love the media and the games and everything else about it.
            I've played a whole lot of the first, second, and third games, but my favorite has to be the third.
            <br> <br>

            <br> <br> I am a big computer fan as well, I've built my own and I plan to upgrade as soon as i get the money,
            my current spec are: Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1070 Ti, 32GB RAM and my mother board is a MSI B550 GAMING PLUS.
            I've also got two monitors, I have a third one on my floor (i call it the Splatoon machine because i only use that 
            one for my switch). I just recently bought another monitor to replace my main one. Both of my monitors currently are 24 inches 144hz and 
            the one I just bought is 27 inches and 170hz. I am excited to see it, its was a early black friday deal from walmart, 
            it was on sale for $145 originally $260!
